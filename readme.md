# Temperature-Changer 

## Description 
Developing on the concept of incrementing and decrementing counters, this temperature changer made using react enables the user to click on '+' and '-' buttons in order to increase or decrease the temperature counter by one with every click. Three main indications have been implemented: when the temperature is lesser than 15°C, the container turns blue in color to display that it is cold. Similarly, when the temperature exceeds 25°C, the container turns orange to show that it is hot. When the temperature lies within 15°C and 25°C, the container changes to turquoise, indicating a mild/neutral temperature. Upper and lower limits have also been provided, thus preventing the user from clicking on and on, beyond 40°C and/or -40°C.
